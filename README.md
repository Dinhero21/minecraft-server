# Minecraft Server

My very cool survival minecraft server

If you are setting the server up yourself, remember to set `white-list` to `true` in `server.properties` or run `whitelist off` to remove the whitelist or `whitelist add yourminecraftusername` in the console to add yourself to the whitelist. I did it this way as this server is intended to be private.

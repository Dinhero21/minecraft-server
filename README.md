# Minecraft Server

My very cool survival minecraft server

## Observations

Because if my very limited auto git updating system, you will need to revert some changes if you want to host the server.

Because this server is intended to be private it has a whitelist so remember to set `white-list` to `false` in `server.properties` or run `whitelist off` to remove the whitelist or `whitelist add yourminecraftusername` in the console to add yourself to the whitelist.

Because `25565` was already in use, the port is currently set to `25570`, to set the port back to `25565` or any other value, remember to set the fields `query.port` and `server-port`.
